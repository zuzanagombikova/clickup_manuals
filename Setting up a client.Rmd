title: "Setting up a client"

---
Do you have a new potential client? Set up their profile so we have all the info in one place.



## Client profile = a task in ClickUp

Keep in mind the task will house the client’s profile & the actions on it before the client is moved to ListenLocal/Data Observatory/Other project.
