### Make sure ALL the information you have are IN the tasks/subtasks.  
The team must be able to work even in case you are temporarily unavailable or decided to replant Amazonas or to restore Siberian tundra and "forgot" take your phone with you.  

If you don't know how to use ClickUp on a regular user level, please check [ClickUp docs](https://docs.clickup.com/en/).
You can also watch the tutorial videos available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJC7egHqghye211WgTuXMAw/) or directly from your profile.
