# Market Research

This is where everything starts.
All new clients are first set up as tasks in Market Research Space.  
  
**The tasks = client profiles must contain all the information we have on the client.**  

  
For more details on how to create a task, see [Setting up a client]().  
  
Once the task/client is created, you can:  
  
- [Comment](https://docs.clickup.com/en/articles/3497985-what-comments-can-do)  
- Assign to other team members, remove yourself  
- Create check list or add an existing Check list template & assign to other team members or yourself  
- Create a subtask & assign to other team members or yourself  
- Fill in custom fields, update timing, add time to time tracker ...  
- Add files/attachments  
- Link the task to other tasks and/or add [dependencies](https://docs.clickup.com/en/articles/1687570-task-dependencies)  
- Modify **status**  

## Status  
There are multiple statuses available, and on request, we can make more. Shall you need more, use Comment section in the task (mention @Zuzana Gombikova) to place your request.
