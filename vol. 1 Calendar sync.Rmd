Link your ClickUp to your Calendar. **How**?

[Google Calendar sync](docs.clickup.com/en/articles/1548755-google-calendar-syncing)

[Calendar syncing with Outlook, Apple Calendar, mobile and more](docs.clickup.com/en/articles/2222732-calendar-syncing-with-outlook-apple-calendar-mobile-and-more)

This is a **ONE-WAY INTEGRATION**:
ClickUp ¬> Settings ¬> Calendar

=> ClickUp creates a copy of its event in your Google Calendar/Apple Calendar/Outlook calendar (let’s call it all GC here):

  - GC event DOES contain: Event name, timing, where in ClickUp does it come from
  
  - GC event DOES NOT contain: task fields, assignees

**Remember:**
-	ClickUp event does NOT send invites to the attendees automatically

-	GC event does NOT send invites to the guests (attendees) automatically

-	After the ClickUp event is created & sent to GC via integration:
      
      - edits in ClickUp event WILL be syncted to GC
      
      - edits in GC event WILL NOT be syncted to ClickUp
